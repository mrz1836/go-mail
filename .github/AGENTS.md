# AGENTS.md

## üéØ Purpose & Scope

This file defines the **baseline standards, workflows, and structure** for *all contributors and AI agents* operating within this repository. It serves as the root authority for engineering conduct, coding conventions, and collaborative norms.

It is designed to help AI assistants (e.g., Codex, Claude, Cursor, Sweep AI) and human developers alike understand our practices, contribute clean and idiomatic code, and navigate the codebase confidently and effectively.

> Whether reading, writing, testing, or committing code, **you must adhere to the rules in this document.**

Additional `AGENTS.md` files **may exist in subdirectories** to provide more contextual or specialized guidance. These local agent files are allowed to **extend or override** the root rules to fit the needs of specific packages, services, or engineering domains‚Äîwhile still respecting the spirit of consistency and quality defined here.
