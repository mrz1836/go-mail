# 🏗️ How We Build Together

Welcome to our humble Go library. We value good ideas, clear communication, and contributions from people who care about great code. This document sets the tone for how we collaborate.

### 🧠 Final Decisions

Project maintainers make the final call. They can revisit and revise past decisions. It keeps things moving.

<br/>

### 🧰 Contributions Welcome

Pitch in! Collaboration is a team sport. Don't leave others carrying your weight forever.

<br/>

### 🎯 Choose Your Adventure

Everyone can tackle whatever challenge they feel ready for. Grab an issue and go!

<br/>

### 🏗️ Earned Roles

Project influence is earned through consistent, quality contributions. Titles mean less than impact.

<br/>

### 🧪 Better > Worse

Good code replaces not-so-good code. Technical merit always wins.

<br/>

### 🔒 Keep It On Topic

This is a space for building software. Let's stay focused.

<br/>

### ⚖️ Take It Elsewhere

If something’s not about the project, take it to another channel. Let's not derail progress.

<br/>

### 🫶 We See People, Not Labels

Your identity—race, gender, beliefs, background—is irrelevant here. Code speaks louder.

<br/>

### 💬 Debate Ideas, Not People

Challenge code. Not humans. No exceptions.

<br/>

### 🔍 Be Clear

If your idea isn't clear, expect questions. If it stays unclear, expect crickets. Help us help you.

<br/>

### 🚫 Illegal is Illegal

Anything illegal outside the project is illegal here too. Keep it clean.

<br/>

### 📦 Project-Only Focus

This code of merit only applies to what happens *in* the project.

<br/>

### ✅ Participation = Agreement

By contributing, you're saying, "Yep, I'm in."

<br/>

### 🎯 Stick to the Mission

Trying to shift this project away from its purpose? That's not cool and won't be allowed.
