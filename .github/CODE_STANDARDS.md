# ✅ Code Standards

Welcome to a modern Go codebase.

This library follows best-in-class practices for clarity, performance, and maintainability.

<br/>

## 🎓 Effective Go

We adhere to the patterns and philosophy in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

Stick to idiomatic code. Avoid cleverness when clarity wins.

<br/>

## 🧰 Project Conventions

Everything lives in our [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) file. Read it. Bookmark it. Trust it.

Here’s a quick overview of what you'll find:
- Directory structure and related governance docs
- Naming conventions for code and files
- Commenting standards and templates
- Development, testing, and coverage standards
- Error handling practices in Go
- Commit and branch naming conventions
- Pull request conventions and required sections
- Labeling conventions for GitHub issues/PRs
- Build system and tooling overview
- And more!

This is intended for AI agents like [GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Claude](https://claude.ai), but also for us human developers too!
