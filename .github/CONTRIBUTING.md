## 🧪 Testing

All tests follow standard Go patterns. We love:

* ✅ [Go Tests](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)
* 📘 [Go Examples](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples)
* ⚡ [Go Benchmarks](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks)

Tests should be:

* Easy to understand
* Focused on one behavior
* Fast

This project aims for >= **90% code coverage**. Every code path must be tested to
keep the Codecov badge green and CI passing.

<br/>

## 🧹 Coding Conventions

We follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), plus:

* 📖 [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc)
* 🧼 [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)
* 🧾 [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/)

Format your code with `gofmt`, lint with `golangci-lint`, and keep your diffs minimal.
