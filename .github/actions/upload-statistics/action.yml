#  Upload Statistics Composite Action (GoFortress)
#
#  Purpose: Standardize all artifact uploads with consistent configuration and
#  security best practices. Provides a unified interface for uploading statistics,
#  cache data, test results, and other workflow artifacts.
#
#  Features:
#    - Wraps actions/upload-artifact with pinned security version
#    - Maintains exact version pinning for security compliance
#    - Preserves retention-days flexibility per workflow needs
#    - Consistent naming and configuration across all uploads
#    - Always runs regardless of job success/failure status
#
#  Usage:
#    - uses: ./.github/actions/upload-statistics
#      with:
#        artifact-name: "cache-stats-pre-commit"
#        artifact-path: "cache-stats-pre-commit.json"
#        retention-days: "1"
