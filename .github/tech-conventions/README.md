## üéØ Using These Conventions

### For New Projects
1. Copy this entire `tech-conventions` directory to your `.github` folder
2. Review each file and adjust project-specific details
3. Reference these conventions in your main documentation

### For Existing Projects
1. Review current practices against these conventions
2. Adopt conventions incrementally
3. Update team documentation to reference relevant sections

### Customization
* These conventions are designed to be forked and modified
* Maintain the structure and formatting for consistency

## ü§ù Contributing

These conventions evolve with best practices. To propose changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`feat/improve-testing-standards`)
3. Make your changes with clear reasoning
4. Submit a PR with the "documentation" label

Remember: Good conventions are discovered through practice, not prescribed in theory.
