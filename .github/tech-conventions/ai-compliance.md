# AI Usage & Assistant Guidelines

This project documents expectations for AI assistants using a few dedicated files:

- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — canonical rules for coding style, workflows, and pull requests used by [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex).
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — quick checklist for the [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/product) agent.
- [.cursorrules](../../.cursorrules) — machine-readable subset of the policies for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) and similar tools.

Edit `AGENTS.md` first when adjusting these policies, and keep the other files in sync within the same pull request.
