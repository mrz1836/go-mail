# Labeling Conventions (GitHub)

> Labels serve as shared vocabulary for categorizing issues, pull requests, and discussions. Proper labeling improves triage, prioritization, automation, and clarity across the engineering lifecycle.

Current labels are located in `.github/labels.yml` and automatically synced into GitHub upon updating the `main/master` branch.

## ðŸ§  Labeling Best Practices

* Apply labels at the time of PR/issue creation, or during triage.
* Use **only one priority label** (`bug-P1`, `P2`, `P3`) per item.
* Combine labels as needed (e.g., `feature` + `ui-ux` + `test`).
* Don't forget to remove outdated labels (e.g., `work-in-progress` â†’ after merge readiness).
* Use `requires-manual-review` for PRs that need human eyes before merging, especially if they involve security or critical changes.
* Use `automerge` only when the PR is fully approved, tested, and ready for production.
* Use `stale` for issues or PRs that have been inactive for 30+ days, to signal they may need attention or closure.
* Use `size/*` labels to indicate the complexity of the change, which helps reviewers understand the effort involved.
* Use `security` for any PR that addresses vulnerabilities, security patches, or sensitive changes that require extra scrutiny.

<br><br>

## ðŸ¤– Automated Labeling

Several labels are applied automatically:

### Size Labels
GitHub Actions automatically calculate and apply size labels based on:
* Lines of code changed
* Number of files modified
* Complexity of changes

### Type Labels
Branch prefixes automatically map to labels:
* `feat/*` â†’ `feature`
* `fix/*` â†’ `bug-P3` (upgrade manually if higher priority)
* `docs/*` â†’ `documentation`
* `test/*` â†’ `test`
* `chore/*` â†’ `chore`

### Bot Labels
* Dependabot PRs automatically receive `dependabot` and `dependencies`
* Stale bot applies `stale` after inactivity period

<br><br>

## ðŸ“‹ Label Groups

Labels are conceptually grouped:

### Priority/Severity
* `bug-P1`, `bug-P2`, `bug-P3`
* `hot-fix`
* `security`

### Type of Change
* `feature`, `bug-*`, `documentation`, `test`
* `refactor`, `chore`, `update`
* `performance`

### Status/State
* `work-in-progress`
* `requires-manual-review`
* `stale`
* `automerge`
* `automated-sync`
* `coverage-override`

### Size/Scope
* `size/XS`, `size/S`, `size/M`, `size/L`, `size/XL`

### Technology/Area
* `docker`, `github-actions`, `gomod`
* `ui-ux`, `devcontainer`
* `dependencies`, `npm`

## ðŸ”§ Managing Labels

### Adding New Labels
1. Update `.github/labels.yml`
2. Submit PR with justification
3. Labels sync automatically on merge

### Renaming Labels
1. Update in `labels.yml`
2. GitHub preserves label associations
3. Update any automation that references old names

### Removing Labels
1. Remove from `labels.yml`
2. Consider impact on existing issues/PRs
3. Manually clean up if needed

> Label changes should be discussed with maintainers to ensure consistency across the project.
